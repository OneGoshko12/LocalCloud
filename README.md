# LocalCloud? *Why??**
I wanted to transfer my images and videos between phones and PCs/laptops at home without losing quality or being limited by file size. I saw an opportunity to build a solution that allows unlimited transfers, with virtually no limit on cloud storage size (GB/TB) â€” the only limit is the storage capacity of the server hosting the application. Best of all, it's completely free and runs locally.

## Features
